# 3.c-install-n-utils
All scripts in this repo are meant to:

(i) automate post-install Fedora KDE and Kubuntu distribution
All files are prefixed with double digit_
0n_ prefix are for immediate tasks to install VPN, tune and update distro, and immediately needed apps such as git, vim, nvim, and vscode.
99_ prefixed scripts will install, un-install, and reinstall other applications.
Scripts are meant to work both for Fedora KDE and Kubuntu, and should work independantly of others.  Therefore all should first check for environment.
Scripts are meant to be re-used for new version of distribution.  So applications that are more challenging to install such as the ones that necessitates Wine, should be installed first.
80_ prefixed scripts are meant to install applications under Wine.

(ii) provide utils to complement desktop environment for daily tasks
those are prefixed with a comma ',', they all lead to a link in /etc/local/sbin
Examples are as follows:
- re-activate wifi networks when broken by VPN
- reduce picture files used by Anki application

(iii) ease administration & maintenance tasks, such as:
- backup volumes
- classify, file, and store documents

This repo, along with the ./_resources directory should be self-sufficient, that is should not call scripts from other repos
